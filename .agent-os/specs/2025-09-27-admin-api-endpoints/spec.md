# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Admin API Endpoints
> Created: 2025-09-27

## Overview

Implement admin-specific API endpoints with pagination, filtering, and sorting capabilities to replace mocked data in the admin frontend application. This will enable real-time admin workflows for quote management, user administration, payment oversight, and driver management.

## User Stories

### Admin Quote Management

As an admin user, I want to view and manage quotes with advanced filtering and pagination, so that I can efficiently oversee all quote operations and make data-driven decisions.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Access paginated quote listing with search functionality
- Filter quotes by status, date range, driver assignment, and customer
- Sort quotes by creation date, amount, status, or driver name
- View quote details with driver assignment capabilities
- Export filtered results for reporting

### Admin Dashboard Metrics

As an admin user, I want to see real-time dashboard metrics and aggregated data, so that I can monitor business performance and identify trends.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- View total quote counts by status (pending, confirmed, completed)
- Monitor revenue metrics and payment statuses
- Track driver availability and assignment rates
- See user growth and registration trends
- Access key performance indicators for business decisions

### Admin User Management

As an admin user, I want to manage user accounts with pagination and search capabilities, so that I can efficiently handle user administration tasks.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Browse paginated user listings with search functionality
- Filter users by registration date, role, or activity status
- Sort users by registration date, last login, or account status
- View user details and account information
- Manage user roles and permissions

## Spec Scope

1. **Admin Quote Listing API** - Extend existing quote controller with admin-specific pagination, filtering, and sorting parameters
2. **Admin User Management API** - Add paginated user listing endpoint with search and filtering capabilities
3. **Admin Payment Dashboard API** - Create paginated payment listing with status filtering and date range queries
4. **Admin Driver Management API** - Implement driver listing endpoint with availability and assignment filtering
5. **Dashboard Metrics API** - Create aggregated metrics endpoint for real-time dashboard data

## Out of Scope

- User authentication and authorization (handled by existing auth system)
- Real-time notifications (future enhancement)
- Advanced reporting features (separate spec)
- Bulk operations on quotes/users (future enhancement)
- Email integration for admin notifications (future enhancement)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Admin APIs** - All five admin endpoints working with proper pagination, filtering, and sorting
2. **Frontend Integration** - Admin frontend successfully consuming real API data instead of mocked data
3. **Performance Validation** - APIs handling expected load with proper response times and error handling
